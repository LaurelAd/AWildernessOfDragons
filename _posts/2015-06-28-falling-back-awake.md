Here is a proposal for a revised framework for our essay. Any and all comments are welcome.

Proposed title of essay: 'Elf-towers and the Mirror' (or something like this).

Key sources: my essay ['On the Shores of the Shoreless Sea'](http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/1182-on-the-shores-of-the-shoreless-sea-simon-cook.php),our own notes on Emyn Beraid and related topics (see especially Oliver's post ['Emyn Beraid and dreams'](http://uoou.github.io/AWildernessOfDragons/emyn-beraid-and-dreams/)), and Flieger's discussions of Lothlórien and Galadriel's mirror in her *A Question of Time*.

Theme: two places, one on the very west of Middle-earth (Emyn Beraid), one in the center (Lothlórien), contain three items (the seeing-stone, the Red Book, and the mirror of Galadriel), the careful contrasting and juxtaposition of all of which (both places and items) illuminates the creative heart of Tolkien's vision of the relationship between our world and Faërie.

Our starting-point is the way that Flieger's discussions (plural, because she deals with time in Lothlórien and the dream-like nature of Galadriel's mirror at different places in her book) suggest some fairly clear-cut points of contrast and comparison with Emyn Beraid and its two 'magical' objects (Seeing-Stone and Book). But while Flieger comes very close to drawing out these points, she does not do so (and does not seem to have thought to do so). As such, development of this theme offers a perfect subject for an essay written in her honour.

In concrete terms: Galadriel's mirror in Lothlórien (the location is as crucial as the object) becomes, in Flieger's reading, another variant of the Stone and Book of Emyn Beraid - in all cases we are exploring (in different ways) the connections and meetings points of dream and waking life, past and present (and future), and the relationship of our Middle-earth to Faërie (both in the uttermost West, beyond the sundering sea, and also in the very ancient past of our own Middle-earth).

Note that Flieger's analysis focuses especially on the related subjects of time and dreams; the latter, she argues, can function in Tolkien's world as perspectives on the temporal flow from without - much as with Galadriel's mirror. It seems no accident that the most forceful presentation of Emyn Beraid in *The Lord of the Rings* is in Frodo's dream (it appears also in the introduction - as a part of hobbit folklore, and in the appendix - as the place Samwise deposited the Red Book). But we are by no means dealing with identical objects: if the elf-towers appear in Frodo's dream, the whole of Lothlórien is a dream state; while Galadriel's mirror shows Frodo the arrival of Elendil on the wings of storm from out of the West, Emyn Beraid houses the stone of Elendil that allowed him (and him alone of mortal men) to look back over the sundering-sea and into the uttermost West. The themes are intimately related, but the objects, their properties and associations are quite distinct. To untangle and mutually illuminate is our goal...

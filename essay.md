>The magic of Faërie is not an end in itself, its virtue is in its operations: among these are the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires. One of these desires is to survey the depths of space and time. (*On Fairy-stories*,para. 16)

###Introduction

Fairy stories are stories about Faërie, not about fairies. This is the point hammered home in the first page of Tolkien's essay 'On Fairy Stories'. The point is developed as the essay proceeds: fairy stories, we begin to understand, are excerises in fantasy, the literary creation of  imaginary 'Other-worlds'. Yet it is the hasty reader who dismisses the significance of elves (that is, fairies) for the enquiry. For elves are the nature denizens of Faërie: living in and by it, they have their being in it (OFS 254), as Tolkien put it in an early draft. To grasp the nature of the perilous realm as a sub-created univerise is to grasp (more or less) the nature of its fay inhabitants.

Fairies, or elves, are the masters of enchantment; the ultimate tellers of fairy stories. This is the subtle, meta-point underlying the whole of Tolkien's essay. In their ideal form, fairy stories are, literally, stories told by fairies. The mortal art of fantasy, that is, of composing 'fairy stories', *aspires* to the true elvish craft of Enchantment. If fantasy imagines a world that satisfies our deepest desires, one of the most profound of these desires is the realisation of fantasy itself. Of 'the desire for a living, realised sub-creative art' the Elves, 'in their better (but still perilous) part are largely made; and it is from them that we may learn what is the central desire and aspiration of human Fantasy' (OFS 64).

All of this is rather abstract and so difficult to grasp. But then, in composing this essay (originally a lecture, delivered in 1939), Tolkien himself was thinking in abstractions - putting his thoughts in order as he prepared to compose his own fairy story, the sequel to *The Hobbit* that we now know as *The Lord of the Rings*. If we turn to the chapter *Many Meetings* of this latter book we find a concrete illustration of some of these key ideas from 'On Fairy Stories'. The scene in question takes place in 'the Hall of Fire' in Rivendell, a place (as Gandalf tells Frodo) where 'you will hear many songs and tales - if you can keep awake.'

>Frodo began to listen.  

>At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though he understood them little, held him in a *spell*, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the *enchantment* became more and more *dreamlike*, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of *sleep*. 

>There he wandered long in a *dream* of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words.

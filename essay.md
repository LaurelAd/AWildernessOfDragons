>The magic of Faërie is not an end in itself, its virtue is in its operations: among these are the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires. One of these desires is to survey the depths of space and time. (OFS 34-5)

###Introduction

Fairy stories are stories about Faërie, not about fairies. This is the point hammered home in the first pages of Tolkien's essay 'On Fairy Stories'. The point is developed further as the essay proceeds. Fairy stories, we begin to understand, are exercises in fantasy, the literary creation of  imaginary 'Other-worlds'. Yet it is the hasty reader who dismisses the significance of fairies. For elves (that is, fairies) are the natural denizens of Faërie: as Tolkien puts it in an early draft: living in and by it, elves have their being in Faërie (OFS 254). To grasp the nature of the perilous realm as a sub-created universe is to grasp (more or less) the nature of its fay inhabitants.

Fairies, or elves, are masters of enchantment, the ultimate tellers of fairy stories. This is the subtle, meta-point underlying the whole of Tolkien's essay. In their ideal form, fairy stories are, literally, stories told by fairies. The mortal art of fantasy, that is, the human composition of 'fairy stories', *aspires* to the true elvish craft of enchantment. Tolkien explains that fantasy imagines a world that satisfies our deepest desires; and he insists (crucially) that one of the most profound of these desires is for the realisation of fantasy itself. Thus, elves are born of our human desire for fantasy to reach the level of true enchanment. Of 'the desire for a living, realised sub-creative art', Tolkien writes, the elves 'in their better (but still perilous) part are largely made; and it is from them that we may learn what is the central desire and aspiration of human Fantasy' (OFS 64).

A level of abstraction, not to mention self-reflexivity, pervades these thoughts, which are very difficult to hold clearly in the mind. But then, in composing this essay (originally a lecture delivered in 1939), Tolkien was thinking in abstractions and very much about his own art as a story teller. What we encounter when we read this essay is the (mortal) master of fantasy attempting to put his own thoughts in order as he prepared to compose his own fairy story, the sequel to *The Hobbit* that we now know as *The Lord of the Rings*. Not surprisingly, within the pages of the latter book we find many concrete embodiments of the above ideas. One such scene, particularly striking in its subtle contrast of mortal and immortal sub-creative art, is set in 'the Hall of Fire' in Rivendell, a place, as Gandalf tells Frodo, where 'you will hear many songs and tales - if you can keep awake':

>Frodo began to listen.  

>At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though he understood them little, held him in a *spell*, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the *enchantment* became more and more *dreamlike*, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of *sleep*. 

>There he wandered long in a *dream* of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words.  

>*Eärendil was a mariner...*      

>(FR, Volume 2, Chapter 1, 'Many Meetings'; emphases added)   

This scene could almost be a prelude to Tolkien's own fairy story. First we encouter the true sub-creative art, or rather, its most perfect expression: words that take shape, conjuring visions of things and places never before imagined, of seas that meet the further shore. Frodo's experience listening to the sweet music of the Elvish minstrels becomes ever more insperable from dream. And then a new voice is heard, a mortal voice; the voice of Bilbo chanting Tolkien's own verse: a lesser attempt to sing of stirring events in the first age of Faërie - an intimation of Tolkien's attempt to (now) tell the great tale of the ending of the Third Age of Middle-earth.

An interesting commentary on this scene is offered immediately after the recitation. Confiding to Frodo, Bilbo remarks that Aragorn, who was supposed to have helped him compose the verse, regarded his very act of singing of Eärendil in the house of Elrond as something of a cheek: 'he obviously thought the whole thing rather above my head... I suppose he was right.' Aragorn highlights the inevitable gap between true elvish enchantment and *any* mortal attempt to tell fairy stories. Yet Frodo's reply to Bilbo is encouraging: 'It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I can't explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about.' 

Frodo here does more than offer words of comfort; he points directly, if elusively, at one of the mysteries of Tolkien's mature sub-creative craft. Dream - somehow - is grasped by Tolkien as an aid to mortal composition and telling of fairy stories. As we shall see, a close reading of his epic story of the end of the Third Age  - the greatest fairy story of the modern age - reveals a pervasive and multifaceted use and invocation of dreams. Our goal in composing this essay is to bring to waking thought the nature and the role of dreams in *The Lord of the Rings*.


###*A Question of Time*

It was Verlyn Flieger who pointed the way... 

```
First few paragraphs: summarize the analysis of dreams in *AQT*, moving through Dunne's theory of dreams and space-time, Lorien as a dream place, and Frodo's dreams. 

Another paragraph: One oddity of Flieger's Tolkien scholarship is that she has covered many core elements of Tolkien's writing, and yet her method is to do so in discrete works that stand independently of one another. Two of Flieger's other books, *Splintered Light* and her edition (together with Douglas Anderson) of OFS, *Tolkien On Fairy-stories*, may shed much light on our inquiry, although in doing so may lead us to revise slightly some of the positions set out in *AQT*.

And another paragraph: *SL* gives us the the frame of the ending of the Second Age with the drowning of Númenor and the loss of the straight way: as Valinor can no longer be reached by direct passage over the ocean, and so the further shore becomes metaphorical, so our Middle-earth becomes less mythical and more historical [This is the August Thesis]. Consequently, the hobbits' journey through Middle-earth becomes a movement, not so much through as in and out of Faërie - pockets of Middle-earth are truly part of the perilous realm, others are simply lands of historical legend.

Penultimate paragraph: 'OFS* gives us the notion that Faërie ultimately rests upon universal human primordial desires, one of which is indeed the realisation of fantasy (expressed in Faërie as the fairy stories or songs of the Elves), but another is the desire for far sight in both space and time. In LOTR we find satisfaction of both desiries, and both are often (not always) connected to dream, or dream-like states of consciousness. 

Final paragraph: putting all the above together: and now turning to ~~Hillam's~~ Tom Hillman's extensive notes on dreams: it is possible to (a) correlate the different dream and dream-like states with (b) the different **places** of Middle-earth (of which some partake of Faërie more than do others) and, thereby, arrive at (c) a slightly revised formulation of the role of dreams in LOTR than that given by Flieger in *AQT*.

```


>[In the Lord of the Rings] dreams are not so much a part of the action as correlative to it.  They correlate the waking and the sleeping worlds, they parallel or contrast conscious with unconscious experience, and they act as chronological markers. Free in a way the rest of the narrative is not to move beyond the confines of conscious experience, the dreams in The Lord of the Rings reach into unsuspected regions of the mind, bridge time and space, and so demonstrate the interrelationship between dreaming and waking that the two states can be seen as a greater whole. (Flieger AQT, 175-76)




###Another Section

Here is where we begin our own argument....

(Everything between here and the bibliography are simply rough notes to be deleted. They should properly be put in a blog or a Wiki (and perhaps will be), but they are here for now because they arose by way of a dialogue with Tom Hillman's extended notes on dreams in LOTR, and I take those notes to be the main basis for the body of our essay.)

Tom: 3 additional things to consider:
1)	The references to the dreams of elves and to memory at FR 2.viii.379; TT 3.ii.429 and 442. 
2)	The Olore Malle in the BoLT, by which mortal children can visit Faerie in their dreams.
3)	According to The Line of Elros in UT, Elendil wrote Akallabeth.  This raises the question, how did he know what was going on in Numenor or, more particularly, with Ar-Pharazon once Ar-Pharazon had set sail for Valinor. Answer: Elendil had the palantir that allowed one to see all the way back to Valinor.  This would make the only use of this palantir that we can even infer.

Simon: a quick comment, having just read quickly through all Tom's notes (note, it was a *very* quick read, and I am *very* tired, and so this could be all wrong). I think there is a distinction that needs to be added to Tom's analysis, and which might alter the conclusions somewhat. The distinction is between (i) normal private dreams (that an individual has when asleep) and (ii) the enchantment of Faerie that is like being in a dream woven by another.

The first is what Dunne analyzed, giving Tolkien the idea of the individual dream as allowing visions of other time and space.

The second is what Tolkien calls 'Faërian Drama', which the experience of being present at 'may be very similar to Dreaming and has (it would seem) sometimes (by men) been confounded with it' (OFS 63). Another word for this experience is (being under an) 'enchantment'.

Now Tom draws a distinction between:

•	Dreamlike Consciousness -- in which the individual seems to himself or another to be dreaming, or in which words such as 'dreamlike,' 'as if in a dream,' 'half in a dream,' etc., would be an apt description.

And,

•	Enchanted Consciousness -- in which the individual's perceptions are altered, for good or for ill, by means of enchantment.

But I am wondering now if this distinction is sustainable - are the first not (always?) states of enchantment in which we are not explicitly told who (or what) is doing the enchantment (but enchantment is the very nature of the environment)? 

Again, Tom writes:
>Frodo says that he feels "like" he is falling asleep.  Merry says it seems "like" a dream, as does Sam on the way to the Grey Havens. But what is "like" a dream, or "like" falling asleep, is by definition NOT a dream and NOT falling asleep.  The distinction between "dream" and dreamlike" could not be more important in a context like this, because it is the difference between what is and what is not a dream. Merry, Sam, and Frodo all know that what happened to them on their adventure was no dream, even if it was so different from their former lives that it might be compared to one. 

This is not wrong, but could perhaps be advanced if we step from "like a dream is NOT a dream" to "like a dream is enchanted" - then we can read at least Merry's statement as nothing to do with dream in its normal sense and all about a return out of an enchnated land, that is, the return from Faërie. (This in itself is no big deal, and I suspect Tom would say I'm just restating the point he was making; but it might be that keeping this distinction betweeen dream and enchantment in mind helps clarify the general discussion).

To be clear, I am thoroughly in agreement with the following:

>Yet how to arrange these three between the other two [waking and sleeping consciousness] is difficult, probably impractical, and most likely irrelevant. The states overlap and blend. Dreams, for example, can be ordinary, like those of Merry and Pippin in Bombadil's house; they can combine with a wider consciousness, like Frodo's that cross time and space; or they can partake of enchanted consciousness as Merry's dream in the barrow seems to do. There is thus no hedge, no river, no line of trees, to mark a clear boundary. The interplay between these states and between the normal world and Faërie argues that these are all, not alternative states or worlds, but integral parts of a greater whole.

Still, we should perhaps pay more explcit attention to the ways that Tolkien wove together the ideas he found in Dunne [private dream accessing space and time] and his own OFS [dream-like state of enchantment by another power] to generate his own enchanted narrative. Lothlorien is one place where the two seem to almost completely merge, but various levels of merging seem to occur throughout LOTR.


A further point, deriving from the second paragraph in the introduction above: in OFS Tolkien identifies elves as *the* denizens of Faërie; but of course, *all* the inhabitants of Faërie 'are in and of Faërie' and 'have their being in its nature'. This surely stands behind the enchantments woven into so much of the narrative of LOTR - from old man willow to the barrow wights to the water of the dead marshes - the things and beings of Faërie are simply doing what they naturally do: casting enchantments (= generating dream-like states of consciousness). *In a way*, all these enchantments are *like* the telling of fairy stories. (But it is only the Elvish form of this enchantment that the mortal composer of fairy stories aspires to imitate).

---- on this last point, Tom writes:

>Song has this power in Middle-earth, to fascinate the mind, to shape its perceptions, and even to bring visions of what is being sung; and this has evidently been so since Ilúvatar said 'Behold your choiring and your music' to the Ainur (The Book of Lost Tales 1.55; Silmarillion 17).  We have seen this before with Old Man Willow, Bombadil, and Goldberry.  We will see it later in Rivendell (2.i.233).

I think 'song' is kind of synonymous with fairy story and both with 'spell of enchantment'. In all cases, what is induced is a dream-like state.

And one final, related, point: as the epigraph above indicates, the desire to make a living sub-creative art is certainly not the only primordial desire that gives rise to fantasy - another such primordial desire is to survey the depths of time and space, which (as we know from our Wiki pages) relates to the palantir, Galadriel's mirror, Tom Bombadil's recollectons, and of course (Dunne's theory of) dreams. My point is that having a 'fairy nature' is not equal (no more and no less) to having an elvish ability of enchantment - their is a fairy element to Dunne's theory of dreams; or put another way, the dreams that Dunne described are the kind of dreams that the traveller in the perilous land is likely to dream.

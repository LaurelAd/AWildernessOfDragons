>The magic of Faërie is not an end in itself, its virtue is in its operations: among these are the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires. One of these desires is to survey the depths of space and time. (*On Fairy-stories*,para. 16)

Fairy stories are fairy stories not because they are stories about fairies, but because they are stories about Faërie. So Tolkien argues in the first pages of his famous essay 'On Fairy Stories'. Yet it would be a hasty reader (there are many) who concludes that Tolkien in this essay has little or nothing to say about Elvies. 



OFS, 35: 'A real dream may indeed sometimes be a fiary-story of almost elvhish ease and skill - while it is being dreamed.'

OFS, 55: 'Fantasy, the making or glimpsing of Other-worlds, was the heart of the desire of Faërie. I desired dragons with a profound desire.'

OFS, 61: 'To make a Secondary World... commanding Secondary Belief... wil certainly demand a special skill, a kind of elvish craft.'

OFS, 63: 'If you are present at a Faërian Drama you yourself are, or tink that you are, bodily inside its Secondary World. The experience may be very similar to Dreaming and has (it would seem) sometimes (by men) been confounded with it... [The Elves] are not deluded. This is for them a form of Art, and distinct from Wizardry or Magic...'

OFS, 63: 'We need a word for this elvish craft'... [it is properly speaking not Magic, but] Enchantment. [64] To this elvish craft, Enchantmnet, Fantasy aspires...

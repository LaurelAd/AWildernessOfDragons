>The magic of Faërie is not an end in itself, its virtue is in its operations: among these are the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires. One of these desires is to survey the depths of space and time. (OFS 34-5)

###Introduction

Fairy stories are stories about Faërie, not about fairies. This is the point hammered home in the first pages of Tolkien's essay 'On Fairy Stories'. The point is developed further as the essay proceeds. Fairy stories, we begin to understand, are exercises in fantasy, the literary creation of  imaginary 'Other-worlds'. Yet it is the hasty reader who dismisses the significance of fairies. For elves (that is, fairies) are the natural denizens of Faërie: as Tolkien puts it in an early draft: living in and by it, elves have their being in Faërie (OFS 254). To grasp the nature of the perilous realm as a sub-created universe is to grasp (more or less) the nature of its fay inhabitants.

Fairies, or elves, are masters of enchantment, the ultimate tellers of fairy stories. This is the subtle, meta-point underlying the whole of Tolkien's essay. In their ideal form, fairy stories are, literally, stories told by fairies. The mortal art of fantasy, that is, the human composition of 'fairy stories', *aspires* to the true elvish craft of enchantment. Tolkien explains that fantasy imagines a world that satisfies our deepest desires; and he insists (crucially) that one of the most profound of these desires is for the realisation of fantasy itself. Thus, elves are born of our human desire for fantasy to reach the level of true enchanment. Of 'the desire for a living, realised sub-creative art', Tolkien writes, the elves 'in their better (but still perilous) part are largely made; and it is from them that we may learn what is the central desire and aspiration of human Fantasy' (OFS 64).

A level of abstraction, not to mention self-reflexivity, pervades these thoughts, which are very difficult to hold clearly in the mind. But then, in composing this essay (originally a lecture delivered in 1939), Tolkien was thinking in abstractions and very much about his own art as a story teller. What we encounter when we read this essay is the (mortal) master of fantasy attempting to put his own thoughts in order as he prepared to compose his own fairy story, the sequel to *The Hobbit* that we now know as *The Lord of the Rings*. Not surprisingly, within the pages of the latter book we find many concrete embodiments of the above ideas. One such scene, particularly striking in its subtle contrast of mortal and immortal sub-creative art, is set in 'the Hall of Fire' in Rivendell, a place, as Gandalf tells Frodo, where 'you will hear many songs and tales - if you can keep awake':

>Frodo began to listen.  

>At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though he understood them little, held him in a *spell*, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the *enchantment* became more and more *dreamlike*, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of *sleep*. 

>There he wandered long in a *dream* of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words.  

>*Eärendil was a mariner...*      

>(FR, Volume 2, Chapter 1, 'Many Meetings'; emphases added)   

This scene could almost be a prelude to Tolkien's own fairy story. First we encouter the true sub-creative art, or rather, its most perfect expression: words that take shape, conjuring visions of things and places never before imagined, of seas that meet the further shore. Frodo's experience listening to the sweet music of the Elvish minstrels becomes ever more inseperable from dream. And then a new voice is heard, a mortal voice; the voice of Bilbo chanting Tolkien's own verse: a lesser attempt to sing of stirring events in the first age of Faërie - an intimation of Tolkien's attempt to (now) tell the great tale of the ending of the Third Age of Middle-earth.

An interesting commentary on this scene is offered immediately after the recitation. Confiding to Frodo, Bilbo remarks that Aragorn, who was supposed to have helped him compose the verse, regarded his very act of singing of Eärendil in the house of Elrond as something of a cheek: 'he obviously thought the whole thing rather above my head... I suppose he was right.' Aragorn highlights the inevitable gap between true elvish enchantment and *any* mortal attempt to tell fairy stories. Yet Frodo's reply to Bilbo is encouraging: 'It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I can't explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about.' 

Frodo here does more than offer words of comfort; he points directly, if elusively, at one of the mysteries of Tolkien's mature sub-creative craft. Dream - somehow - is grasped by Tolkien as an aid to mortal composition and telling of fairy stories. As we shall see, a close reading of his epic story of the end of the Third Age - the greatest fairy story of the modern age - reveals a pervasive and multifaceted use and invocation of dreams. Our goal in composing this essay is to bring to waking thought the nature and the role of dreams in *The Lord of the Rings*.


###*A Question of Time*

As with so many paths in Tolkien studies, Verlyn Flieger points us on our way. Tolkien's conception and use of dream is a vital, if utlimately subordinate theme in her 1997 book, *A Question of Time*. As her title suggests, Flieger is first and foremost interested in the role of time (or space-time) in Tolkien's fiction. As such, dreams concern her primarily as a means by which Tolkien revealed something beyond normal waking experiences of time (AQT 4). The relationship of dream and time is established by way of J.W. Dunne's *An Experiment with Time* (1927). Dunne had argued that, while our waking experience of time is a moment-by-moment flow, in reality all of time (like space) is always present, and that in dream the mind may extend its range of observation of time, looking forward into the future as well as backward into the past (see AQT 39-47). By way of some brilliant detective work, the influence of Dunne is revealed by Flieger at several key points in *The Lord of the Rings*. This leads to the conclusion that Tolkien here employed dreams mainly in order to reveal both unexpected depths to, and also developments in the *consiousness* of his characters, most imporantly Frodo.

Flieger deals with dreams head-on in two late chapters of *A Question of Time*: 'Frodo's Dreams' (chapter 8) and 'Falling Asleep Again' (chapter 9). The first treats of the actual dreams of individuals, most notably those of Frodo. Again and again, Flieger shows how these dreams are vehicles for the thematic development of Dunne's theory, taking the dreamer across space-time and providing acess to something the waking self of the dreamer could not possibly know. This leads her to the following generalization about the place of dreams in *The Lord of the Rings*:

>dreams are not so much a part of the action as correlative to it. They correlate the waking and the sleeping worlds, they parallel or contrast conscious with unconscious experience, and they act as chronological markers. Free in a way the rest of the narrative is not to move beyond the confines of conscious experience, the dreams in *The Lord of the Rings* reach into unsuspected regions of the mind, bridge time and space, and so demonstrate the interrelationship between dreaming and waking that the two states can be seen as a greater whole. (Flieger AQT, 175-76)

Flieger is quite clear that most of the dreams in *The Lord of the Rings* 'are presented quite explicitly as dreams'. Nevertheless, her chapter 'Falling Asleep Again' addresses those times when, as she puts it, 'the narrative actions and the dream are so entangled that we find ourselves participating in a kind of waking-dream'. The most obvious such entanglement is Lórien, which Flieger argues is in a basic sense a dream. Here she extrapolates in part from Tolkien's discussion of ‘Faërian Drama’ in his lecture on fairy stories, and astutely comments that when Sam, in Lórien, says that he feels as if he is ‘inside a song’, this might sounds like metaphor but is meant by Tolkien as a true description of a hidden reality - Sam is in truth inside a song, inside an artistic creation, a ‘Faërian Drama’, woven by some other mind (AQT 192). We shall return to these ideas later in the essay. 

The 'dream' that most interests Flieger in this second chapter on dreams is 'one that does not appear to be a dream at all until nearly the end of the story' (AQT 196). On their way home, on the road from Bree and just after Gandalf has left the hobbits to visit Tom Bombadil, the following exchange occurs between Merry and Frodo:

>'Well here we are, just the four of us that started out together,' said Merry. 'We have left all the rest behind, one after another. It seems almost like a dream that has slowly faded.'  
>'Not to me,' said Frodo. 'To me it feels more like falling asleep again.' (RK, Ch 8)

Flieger suggests that we take Frodo's statement seriously, and she points to the early sequence of adventures experienced by the hobbits on leaving the Shire as marking the gradual commencement of what she calls 'Frodo's waking dream' (198). She points out that in each of these adventures - Old Man Willow in the Old Forest, Tom Bombadil, and the Barrow-wight - 'dreaming and waking are interwoven' (AQT 200) and 'interconnected' (AQT 202-3). These first three adventures, Flieger argues, set the scene for Frodo's general experience on leaving the house at Crickhollow, namely, a falling 'wide asleep into a dream so vivid that ordinary waking life takes on the evanescent quality of a dream in comparison', and the entering of 'a world in which waking experience becomes the stuff of dreams, often of nightmares, and in which their dreams cross over into waking experience' (AQT 199). This whole experience, essentially the whole adventure of Frodo, Flieger sees as bridged by Frodo's reciprocal visions of the further shore beyond the sundering sea: 'white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise. First dreamed of in the house of Tom Bombadil, then seen on the ship that bears him from the Grey Havens; what was dream at the beginning of the adventure becomes waking reality at the end of the story.' This, for Flieger, is Tolkien's ultimate illustration and application of Dunne's theory of time.

>The magic of Faërie is not an end in itself, its virtue is in its operations: among these are the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires. One of these desires is to survey the depths of space and time. (OFS 34-5)

###Introduction

Fairy stories are stories about Faërie, not about fairies. This is the point hammered home in the first pages of Tolkien's essay 'On Fairy Stories'. The point is developed further as the essay proceeds. Fairy stories, we begin to understand, are exercises in fantasy, the literary creation of  imaginary 'Other-worlds'. Yet it is the hasty reader who dismisses the significance of fairies. For elves (that is, fairies) are the natural denizens of Faërie: as Tolkien puts it in an early draft: living in and by it, elves have their being in Faërie (OFS 254). To grasp the nature of the perilous realm as a sub-created universe is to grasp (more or less) the nature of its fay inhabitants.

Fairies, or elves, are masters of enchantment, the ultimate tellers of fairy stories. This is the subtle, meta-point underlying the whole of Tolkien's essay. In their ideal form, fairy stories are, literally, stories told by fairies. The mortal art of fantasy, that is, the human composition of 'fairy stories', *aspires* to the true elvish craft of enchantment. Tolkien explains that fantasy imagines a world that satisfies our deepest desires; and he insists (crucially) that one of the most profound of these desires is for the realisation of fantasy itself. Thus, elves are born of our human desire for fantasy to reach the level of true enchanment. Of 'the desire for a living, realised sub-creative art', Tolkien writes, the elves 'in their better (but still perilous) part are largely made; and it is from them that we may learn what is the central desire and aspiration of human Fantasy' (OFS 64).

A level of abstraction, not to mention self-reflexivity, pervades these thoughts, which are very difficult to hold clearly in the mind. But then, in composing this essay (originally a lecture delivered in 1939), Tolkien was thinking in abstractions and very much about his own art as a story teller. What we encounter when we read this essay is the (mortal) master of fantasy attempting to put his own thoughts in order as he prepared to compose his own fairy story, the sequel to *The Hobbit* that we now know as *The Lord of the Rings*. Not surprisingly, within the pages of the latter book we find many concrete embodiments of the above ideas. One such scene, particularly striking in its subtle contrast of mortal and immortal sub-creative art, is set in 'the Hall of Fire' in Rivendell, a place, as Gandalf tells Frodo, where 'you will hear many songs and tales - if you can keep awake':

>Frodo began to listen.  

>At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though he understood them little, held him in a *spell*, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the *enchantment* became more and more *dreamlike*, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of *sleep*. 

>There he wandered long in a *dream* of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words.  

>*Eärendil was a mariner...*      

>(FR, Volume 2, Chapter 1, 'Many Meetings'; emphases added)   

This scene could almost be a prelude to Tolkien's own fairy story. First we encouter the true sub-creative art, or rather, its most perfect expression: words that take shape, conjuring visions of things and places never before imagined, of seas that meet the further shore. Frodo's experience listening to the sweet music of the Elvish minstrels becomes ever more insperable from dream. And then a new voice is heard, a mortal voice; the voice of Bilbo chanting Tolkien's own verse: a lesser attempt to sing of stirring events in the first age of Faërie - an intimation of Tolkien's attempt to (now) tell the great tale of the ending of the Third Age of Middle-earth.

An interesting commentary on this scene is offered immediately after the recitation. Confiding to Frodo, Bilbo remarks that Aragorn, who was supposed to have helped him compose the verse, regarded his very act of singing of Eärendil in the house of Elrond as something of a cheek: 'he obviously thought the whole thing rather above my head... I suppose he was right.' Aragorn highlights the inevitable gap between true elvish enchantment and *any* mortal attempt to tell fairy stories. Yet Frodo's reply to Bilbo is encouraging: 'It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I can't explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about.' 

Frodo here does more than offer words of comfort; he points directly, if elusively, at one of the mysteries of Tolkien's mature sub-creative craft. Dream - somehow - is grasped by Tolkien as an aid to mortal composition and telling of fairy stories. As we shall see, a close reading of his epic story of the end of the Third Age  - the greatest fairy story of the modern age - reveals a pervasive and multifaceted use and invocation of dreams. Our goal in composing this essay is to bring to waking thought the nature and the role of dreams in *The Lord of the Rings*.


###*A Question of Time*

As with so many paths in Tolkien studies, Verlyn Flieger here points us on our way. Tolkien's conception and use of dream is a vital, if utlimately subordinate theme in her 1997 book, *A Question of Time*. As her title suggests, Flieger is first and foremost interested in the role of time (or space-time) in Tolkien's fiction. As such, dreams concern her primarily as a means of moving beyond normal waking experiences of time (AQT 4). The relationship of dream and time is established by way of J.W. Dunne's *An Experiment with Time* (1927). Dunne had argued that, while our waking experience of time is a moment-by-moment flow, in reality all of time (like space) is always present, and that in dream the mind may extend its range of observation of time, looking forward into the future as well as backward into the past (see AQT 39-47). By way of some brilliant detective work, the influence of Dunne is revealed by Flieger at several key points in *The Lord of the Rings*. This leads to the conclusion that in this work Tolkien employed dreams mainly in order to reveal both unexpected depths to, and also developments in the consiousness of his characters, most imporantly Frodo.

In *A Question of Time* Flieger deals with dreams head-on in two late chapters, 'Frodo's Dreams' (chapter 8) and 'Falling Asleep Again' (chapter 9). The first treats of actual dreams of individuals, most notably those of Frodo. Again and again, Flieger shows how these dreams are vehichles for the thematic development of Dunne's theory, taking the dreamer across space-time and providing acess to something the waking self of the dreamer could not possibly know. In general, Flieger claims with regard to *The Lord of the Rings*:

>dreams are not so much a part of the action as correlative to it. They correlate the waking and the sleeping worlds, they parallel or contrast conscious with unconscious experience, and they act as chronological markers. Free in a way the rest of the narrative is not to move beyond the confines of conscious experience, the dreams in *The Lord of the Rings* reach into unsuspected regions of the mind, bridge time and space, and so demonstrate the interrelationship between dreaming and waking that the two states can be seen as a greater whole. (Flieger AQT, 175-76)

Flieger begins her chapter, 'Falling Asleep Again', with the claim that  most of the dreams in *The Lord of the Rings* 'are presented quite explicitly as dreams'. Nevertheless, she notes, there are times 'when the narrative actions and the dream are so entangled that we find ourselves participating in a kind of waking-dream'. The most obvious such entangelement is Lórien, which Flieger argues is in a basic sense a dream. Here she extrapolates in part from Tolkien's discussion of ‘Faërian Drama’ in his lecture on fairy stories, and astutely comments that when Sam, in Lórien, says he feels as if he is ‘inside a song’, we take as a metaphor what Tolkien means as a hidden reality - Sam is in truth inside a song, inside an artistic creation, a ‘Faërian Drama’, woven by some other mind (AQT 192). We shall return to these ideas later in the essay.

196: The deepest dream, and the longest, may well be one that does not appear to be a dream at all until nearly the end of the story. When the War of the Ring has ended… [Merry: ‘It seems almost like a dream that has slowly faded.’ ‘Not to me’, says Frodo. ‘To me it feels more like falling asleep again’.] 
198: While the end of what I shall call Frodo’s waking dream is fairly well marked… no such explicit description marks the beginning… Instead, there is a series of small clues that taken together suggest such a tradition, widely separated phrases hardly to be noticed and acquiring their larger meaning only in retrospect… [Crossing Brandywine = 1 such; [199] entering Old Forest = another] In order to understand Frodo’s adventures from this point in terms of the dream/reality reversal implied by his own words to Merry… we must take a fresh look at the whole center of the book. We must re-view the whole of Frodo’s journey from Crickhollow to the Cracks of Doom as if he has fallen wide asleep into a dream so vivid that ordinary waking life takes on the evanescent quality of a dream in comparison. Once he and his companions are outside the Shire, they enter a world in which waking experience becomes the stuff of dreams, often of nightmares, and in which their dreams cross over into waking experience. They are from now until the end of the journey in a world far removed from ordinary daylight experience. Its first shadowy region is the Old Forest, the next the storied, haunted Barrow-downs… In quick succession the hobbits encounter Willow Man, Tom Bombadill, and the Barrow-wight, ‘creatures of night brought to light.’ Each of these… has a pronounced dreamlike quality…
The first, and the most explicitly associated with dream-conditions, is Willow Man. [200] sleep is the operative word in the Willow Man sequence… [Quotes: ‘You were dreaming, I expect, Mr. Frodo’ – F: If coming back to the Shire feels to Frodo like falling asleep again, then his enchanted sleep in the Withywindle Valley must be a dream within a dream…
200: [Barrow sequence] here, as in the Old Forest, dreaming and waking are interwoven.
202: [Tom’s house] here dream and waking [203] are interconnected, that in their experience in Tom’s house the hobbits, and especially Frodo, are waking up to a reality more real than anything in their previous experience.
--- this all ends with a discussion of Frodo’s dream in the house of TB of the far green country and swift sunset, which is somehow meant to show the end of the dream…. ??

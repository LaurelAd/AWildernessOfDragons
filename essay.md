>The magic of Faërie is not an end in itself, its virtue is in its operations: among these are the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires. One of these desires is to survey the depths of space and time. (OFS 34-5)

###Introduction

Fairy stories are stories about Faërie, not about fairies. This is the point hammered home in the first pages of Tolkien's essay 'On Fairy Stories'. The point is developed further as the essay proceeds. Fairy stories, we begin to understand, are excerises in fantasy, the literary creation of  imaginary 'Other-worlds'. Yet it is the hasty reader who dismisses the significance of fairies. For elves (that is, fairies) are the natural denizens of Faërie: as Tolkien puts it in an early draft: living in and by it, elves have their being in Faërie (OFS 254). To grasp the nature of the perilous realm as a sub-created universe is to grasp (more or less) the nature of its fay inhabitants.

Fairies, or elves, are masters of enchantment, the ultimate tellers of fairy stories. This is the subtle, meta-point underlying the whole of Tolkien's essay. In their ideal form, fairy stories are, literally, stories told by fairies. The mortal art of fantasy, that is, the human composition of 'fairy stories', *aspires* to the true elvish craft of enchantment. Tolkien explains that fantasy imagines a world that satisfies our deepest desires; and he insists (crucially) that one of the most profound of these desires is for the realisation of fantasy itself. Thus, elves are born of our human desire for fantasy to reach the level of true enchanment. Of 'the desire for a living, realised sub-creative art', Tolkien writes, the elves 'in their better (but still perilous) part are largely made; and it is from them that we may learn what is the central desire and aspiration of human Fantasy' (OFS 64).

A level of abstraction, not to mention self-reflexicity, pervades these thoughts, which are very difficult to hold clearly in the mind. But then, in composing this essay (originally a lecture delivered in 1939), Tolkien was thinking in abstractions and very much about his own art as a story teller. What we encounter when we read this essay is the master of (mortal) fantasy attempting to put his own thoughts in order as he prepared to compose his own fairy story, the sequel to *The Hobbit* that we now know as *The Lord of the Rings*. Not surprisingly, within the pages of the latter book we find many concrete embodiments of the above ideas. One such scene, particularly striking in its subtle contrast of mortal and immortal sub-creative art, is set in 'the Hall of Fire' in Rivendell, a place, as Gandalf tells Frodo, where 'you will hear many songs and tales - if you can keep awake':

>Frodo began to listen.  

>At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though he understood them little, held him in a *spell*, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the *enchantment* became more and more *dreamlike*, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of *sleep*. 

>There he wandered long in a *dream* of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words.  

>*Eärendil was a mariner...*      

>(FR, Volume 2, Chapter 1, 'Many Meetings'; emphases added)   

This scene could almost be a prelude to Tolkien's own fairy story. First we encouter the true sub-creative art, or rather, its most perfect expression: words that take shape, conjuring visions of things and places never before imagined, of seas that meet the further shore. Frodo's experience listening to the sweet music of the Elvish minstrels becomes ever more insperable from dream. And then a new voice is heard, a mortal voice; the voice of Bilbo chanting Tolkien's own verse: a lesser attempt to sing of stirring events in the first age of Faërie - an intimation of Tolkien's attempt to (now) tell the great tale of the ending of the Third Age of Middle-earth.

An interesting commentary on this scene is offered immediately after the recitation. Confiding to Frodo, Bilbo remarks that Aragorn, who was supposed to have helped him compose the verse, regarded his very act of singing of Eärendil in the house of Elrond as something of a cheek: 'he obviously thought the whole thing rather above my head... I suppose he was right.' Aragorn highlights the inevitable gap between true elvish enchantment and *any* mortal attempt to tell fairy stories. Yet Frodo's reply to Bilbo is encouraging: 'It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I can't explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about.' 

Frodo here does more than offer words of comfort; he points directly, if elusively, at one of the mysteries of Tolkien's mature sub-creative craft. Dream - somehow - is grasped by Tolkien as an aid to mortal composition and telling of fairy stories. As we shall see, a close reading of his epic story of the end of the Third Age  - the greatest fairy story of the modern age - reveals a pervasive and multifaceted use and invocation of dreams. Our goal in composing this essay is to bring to waking thought the nature and the role of dreams in *The Lord of the Rings*.


###*A Question of Time*

It was Verlyn Flieger who pointed the way... 
[Here we summarize Fliger's AQT and then courteously draw attention to what we regard as its shortcomings, which Tom identifies with the two late chapters dealing with Frodo's dreams.]

Flieger writes (175-76):

>"[In the Lord of the Rings] dreams are not so much a part of the action as correlative to it.  They correlate the waking and the sleeping worlds, they parallel or contrast conscious with unconscious experience, and they act as chronological markers. Free in a way the rest of the narrative is not to move beyond the confines of conscious experience, the dreams in The Lord of the Rings reach into unsuspected regions of the mind, bridge time and space, and so demonstrate the interrelationship between dreaming and waking that the two states can be seen as a greater whole."




###Another Section

Here is where we begin our own argument....

Simon: a quick comment, having just read quickly through all Tom's notes (note, it was a *very* quick read, and I am *very* tired, and so this could be all wrong). I think there is a distinction that needs to be added to Tom's analysis, and which might alter the conclusions somewhat. The distinction is between (i) normal private dreams (that an individual has when asleep) and (ii) the enchantment of Faerie that is like being in a dream woven by another.

The first is what Dunne analyzed, giving Tolkien the idea of the individual dream as allowing visions of other time and space.

The second is what Tolkien calls 'Faërian Drama', which the experience of being present at 'may be very similar to Dreaming and has (it would seem) sometimes (by men) been confounded with it' (OFS 63). Another words for this experience is (being under an) 'enchantment'.

A lot of the dream references in LOTR noted by Tom are to dream-*like* states, and rather than reading this as being a semi-dream state (which is what I *think* Tom does) it might be safer to classify them as simply 'enchanted states'. I'm not sure if or how this impacts upon Tom's criticisms of Flieger's interpretation of Frodo's 'falling back asleep again' in returning to the Shire, but my (sleepy) intuition is that there is some impact.

Two further points:

1. The two distinct types - dream and dream-like - seem to come together in Lothlorien, or at least in Galadriel's mirror. (And certainly, in adopting Dunne's dream theory, Tolkien must have been aware of its resonance to his ideas of enchantment as dream-like).

2. A quite different point, deriving from the second paragraph in the introduction: in OFS Tolkien identifies elves as *the* denizens of Faërie; but of course, *all* the inhabitants of Faërie 'are in and of Faërie' and 'have their being in its nature'. This surely stands behind the enchantments woven into so much of the narrative of LOTR - from old man willow to the barrow wights to the water of the dead marshes - the things and beings of Faërie are simply doing what they naturally do: casting enchantments (= generating dream-like states of consciousness). *In a way*, all these enchantments are *like* the telling of fairy stories. (But it is only the Elvish form of this enchantment that the mortal composer of fairy stories aspires to imitate).

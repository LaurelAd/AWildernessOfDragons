>The magic of Faërie is not an end in itself, its virtue is in its operations: among these are the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires. One of these desires is to survey the depths of space and time. (*On Fairy-stories*,para. 16)

###Introduction

Fairy stories are stories about Faërie, not about fairies. This is the point hammered home in the first page of Tolkien's essay 'On Fairy Stories'. The point is developed as the essay proceeds: fairy stories, we begin to understand, are excerises in fantasy, the literary creation of  imaginary 'Other-worlds'. Yet it is the hasty reader who dismisses the significance of elves (that is, fairies). For elves are the nature denizens of Faërie: living in and by it, they have their being in it, as Tolkien puts it in an early draft (OFS 254). To grasp the nature of the perilous realm as a sub-created univerise is to grasp (more or less) the nature of its fay inhabitants.

Fairies, or elves, are the masters of enchantment; the ultimate tellers of fairy stories. This is the subtle, meta-point underlying the whole of Tolkien's essay. In their ideal form, fairy stories are, literally, stories told by fairies. The mortal art of fantasy, that is, of composing 'fairy stories', *aspires* to the true elvish craft of Enchantment. If fantasy imagines a world that satisfies our deepest desires, one of the most profound of these desires is the realisation of fantasy itself. Of 'the desire for a living, realised sub-creative art' the elves 'in their better (but still perilous) part are largely made; and it is from them that we may learn what is the central desire and aspiration of human Fantasy' (OFS 64).

A level of abstraction, not to mention self-reflexicity, pervades these thoughts, which are very difficult to hold clearly in the mind. But then, in composing this this essay (originally a lecture, delivered in 1939), Tolkien was thinking in abstractions and very much about his own art as a story teller. What we read in this essay is the attempt of the master of (mortal) fantasy attempting to put his own thoughts in order as he prepared to compose his own fairy story, the sequel to *The Hobbit* that we now know as *The Lord of the Rings*. Not surprisingly, within the pages of the latter book we find many concrete embodiments of the above ideas. One such scene, particularly striking in its subtle contrast of mortal and immortal sub-creative art, is set in 'the Hall of Fire' in Rivendell, a place (as Gandalf tells Frodo) where 'you will hear many songs and tales - if you can keep awake.'

>Frodo began to listen.  

>At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though he understood them little, held him in a *spell*, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the *enchantment* became more and more *dreamlike*, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of *sleep*. 

>There he wandered long in a *dream* of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words.  

>*Eärendil was a mariner...*      (FR, Volume 2, Chapter 1, 'Many Meetings'; emphases added)

This scene is almost as a prelude to Tolkien's own fairy story. We first encouter the true sub-creative art, or rather, its most perfect expression: words that take shape, opening up vistas of things and places never before imagined: the seas that meet the further shore are conjured up before Frodo, whose experience of hearing the sweet music of the Elvish minstrels becomes ever more insperable from dream. And then a new voice is heard, a mortal voice, a lesser attempt to sing of stirring events in the first age of Faërie - an intimation of Tolkien's attempts to (now) tell the great tale of the ending of the Third Age of Middle-earth.

An interesting commentary on this scene is offered immediately after the recitation, as Bilbo tells Frodo that Aragorn regarded his verse as a bit of a cheek: 'he obviously thought the whole thing rather above my head', Bilbo tells Frodo. 'I suppose he was right.' Aragorn thus highlights the gap between true elvish enchantment and mortal attempt to tell fairy stories:  Yet Frodo's words to Bilbo are encouraging: 'It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I can't explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about.'

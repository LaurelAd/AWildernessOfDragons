# A Wilderness of Dragons

*An essay composed for a volume of [essays in honour of Verlyn Flieger](http://sacnoths.blogspot.co.il/2015/05/verlyn-flieger-festschrit-call-for.html)*

Researched and written collaboratively by Simon J. Cook, Oliver Stegen, and anyone else who cares to contribute.

### Tentative title and theme: 'The vision of enchantment: (far) sight in Tolkien's stories'

How are we to understand the important role accorded to visual magic in the great spell of enchantment that we know as *The Lord of the Rings*?

For Tolkien the mortal audience of a fairy story are enchanted by the words of the story. Telling enchanted stories is an Elvish art. But Elves are also magical beings, possesing (among other qualities) far-sight; they can also make magical objects (e.g. palantíri) that give far-sight to mortal men. Magical vision is a central motif in Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings*: Sauron as the great eye in the Dark Tower; Galadriel with her mirror, the palantíri, not to mention various dreams and other moments (such as Frodo at Amon Hen). How, then, are we to understand the role and meaning of magical *vision* in this enchanted *story*?
